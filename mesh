wireframe mesh
  defining points are used to draw edges that surround an object
  
polygon mesh
  needed to render 3D
  
add_ functions add triangles to the polygon matrix
what sides are visible?
VERTICES NEED TO BE ADDED IN C O U N T E R C L O C K W I S E ORDER

Hidden Surface Removal
  ignore back-facing polygons
  v-> vector from the surface of the polygon to the viewer
  n-> surface normal: vector perp to the surface of polygon
  
  if pointing at the viewer: angle is 0 deg (not from my eye out but into my eye!)
  from -90 to 90 we can see a surface.
1. calculate n->
    find 2 vectors that share an Endpoint and go out from the the common point
    A = p1 - p0 = < x1-x0,...>
    B = p2 - p0
    N = A x B 
        <ay*bz-az*by, azbx-axbz, axby-aybx>
    N dot V = NVcos(theta), cos(theta) is always positive if it is our range!!!
    a hardcoded V: <0,0,1>
  Do this is the draw step not the add step!
2. find theta btwn n and v
3. if -90 < theta < 90, draw the polygon
