lighting & shading

2 kinds of light
  ambient light: light that permeates entire image
  point light sources: 
  calculating lighting:
    I : color(illumination) of a surface
    I = Iambient + Idiffuse + Ispecular
    
    only one ambient
    ambient 255 255 255
    light l1 [0 1 1]=xyzposition 255 0 255
    constants white 0.25 0.5 0.25 [these 3 is Ired = Ia+Id+Is] 0.25 0.5 0.25 0.25 0.5 0.25
    if constants white 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 >>IT'S ALL AMBIENT LIGHT! 
     
we need:
  normalized Vector
  magnitude = 1
  magnitude ||V|| = sqrt(Vx^2 + Vy^2 + Vz^2)
  normalized Vhat = <Vx/||V||, Vy..., Vz..>
  
  Ambient reflection:
      A: color value of ambient light? <color value>
      Ka: Constant of ambient reflection <0-1>
      Iambient = A*Ka
      
  Diffuse:
      L: point light source <x,y,z>, (0-255..)
          vector and color
      Ka: constant of diffuse
      light is reflected EVENLY in all directions -- rough surface
          there is a DIFFERENCE between light being reflected evenly, and light coming evenly
          reflection is greatest when angle of reflection (incidence, to normal) is Zero
                model using COSINE!
      Idiffuse = L*Kd*cos(theta) = L*Kd*(dotprod(N, L))
  
  Specular
       reflected light follows specific vector
       BUT... the VIEW vector matters!! reflection strongest when alpha (difference between Reflected and View vector)
       
      Ispecular = L*Ks*cos(alpha)
        cos(alpha) = R dot V
        R> = P> + S> (vector stuff)
        P> is the PROJECTION OF L> onto N> (the normal)
            P> = N>(N> dot L>)
        S> = P> + L>
        R = P + P - L = 2P - L
        R = (N*2(N dot L)) - (L) ***NOTE THAT IT'S VECTOR SUBTRACTION!!
