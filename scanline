filling in polygons by drawing consecutive horizontal OR vertical lines
keep track of the x and y together
find Bottom, middle and top vertices
  map BMT to V0 V1 V2 -> P0
 
what are the endpoints to these lines?
Y: starts at Bottom y, -> Top y
  dy = 1
first time is just.. B to B

X0: Bx -> Tx
X1: Bx -> Mx
    then! Mx -> Tx
      when do we know we've hit Mx? use My!
  dx0 = (Tx - Bx) / (Ty - By)
  dx1 = (Mx - Bx) / (My - By) #DEGENERATE: DIVISION BY ZERO
  dx1 part two (Tx - My)/(Ty - My)
  
  using ? in python

There isn't that much ~special cases~.. even if you have two bottoms, just choose one to be bottom
